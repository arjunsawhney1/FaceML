# FaceML
In this repo, I demonstrate how simple Linear Algebra concepts can be utilized for powerful image element detection applications

## Data
I use the Olivetti faces data-set from AT&T, downloaded using the `sklearn` package

## Methods
In the notebook above, I use eigenvectors and dot products to detect and classify facial features. 
Specifically, I demonstrate how to detect eyeglass wearers and cluster faces by similar facial features such as the presence of a smile or facial hair.
