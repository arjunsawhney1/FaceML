# FaceML
In this repo, I demonstrate how simple Linear Algebra concepts can be utilized for powerful image element detection applications

## Data
I use the Olivetti faces data-set from AT&T 

## The Problem
I use eigenvectors and dot products to detect and classify facial features. 
In the notebook above, I detect eyeglass wearers and cluster faces by similarity in facial features. 
In practice, this clustering is able to detect faces and facial features such as the presence of a smile or facial hair
